#User Stories

As a developer, I...
- want to use consistent and descriptive console.log throughout my code to help test my work and debug
- want to consider the UX of my app from the perspective of someone who is giving the feedback
- want to create an engaging survey for users through effective content design and flow
- want to make my code clear, concise, and aligned with the market analysis needs of BusMall
- want to generate a random set of three products from the BusMall inventory 25 times, allow the user to select one, and then track and store the results


As a focus group participant, I...
- want to be drawn in visually by the app (clean lines, tasteful colors)
- want the options to be displayed symmetrically and in similar size so it's easy to read/choose from
- want to have a smooth experience moving through the choices presented
- move quickly from option to option so that I last for 25 rounds
- have clear directions and prompts if I accidentally click elsewhere

As the marketing research team, we...
- want an effective/engaging app to gauge potential customer interest in our products
- want accurate numbers for how many times an item is shown to a user, and how many times it is selected from a random collection of three
- want the above numbers to be shown in a table that is clear and organized
- want the user to have a positive experience while they give feedback
- want the developer to deliver on time ;)
